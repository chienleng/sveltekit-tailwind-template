# SvelteKit and Tailwind CSS starter

Everything _I_ need to quickly setup a SvelteKit and Tailwind project.

Core packages:

- [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) - foundation
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - for styling

Optional packages:

- [date-fns](https://date-fns.org/) - for manupulating dates
- [superforms](https://superforms.rocks/) - for form validation
- [layercake](https://layercake.graphics/) - for data visualisation

## Installation

Open terminal

```bash
npm install
```

## Developing

```bash
npm run dev

```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
